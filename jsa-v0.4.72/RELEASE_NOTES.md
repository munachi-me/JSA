## Release purpose

Phase 7 Milestone 4: conditional updates to existing columns and appearance refinements.

## New features

- `updateConditional` step: update values in an existing column with ordered IF rules whose conditions may reference other columns.
- Hex colour entry, recent-colour reuse, and copying colours between appearance fields in Export Appearance Studio.

## Improvements

- Unmatched cells are preserved when the fallback is blank, and results are validated against the target column's data type.
- Automatic chronological sorting in interactive exports recognises month, weekday, quarter, week, year, date/datetime, and time labels.

## Scope relative to the previous release

- No new source modules were added; this release changed existing modules.
- Pipeline steps added: `updateConditional`.
- Application code: 5,918 → 5,984 lines (+66).

Compared against [v0.4.71](../jsa-v0.4.71/RELEASE_NOTES.md).

## Breaking changes

None recorded. No source module present in the previous release was removed, and no route was renamed or dropped, as verified by comparing the source trees.

## Compatibility and migration

Each version directory is an independent project with its own `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. To use this release, install its dependencies inside its own folder; installing at the repository root does not apply to any version.

Datasets persisted in IndexedDB are keyed to the browser origin. Running a different version folder on a different dev-server port is a different origin, so previously saved work will not appear there. Workspace data is not migrated between versions by the repository.

## Verification status

| Check | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Test suite | **Not executed** in this documentation pass. |
| Production build | **Not executed** in this documentation pass. |
| Browser behaviour | **Not verified** — no browser session was driven during documentation. |
| Coverage | **Not measured.** No coverage figure is claimed. |

"Executed and passed" above means the command was run against this exact folder in the documentation environment and exited successfully. It does not mean every feature was exercised, and it does not constitute a browser or security verification.
