## Release purpose

Phase 8 Milestone 1: smart KPI and chart suggestions.

## New features

- Explainable, opt-in KPI recommendations derived from dataset structure (record counts, numeric totals/averages, distinct category counts).
- Chart Builder suggestions for temporal trends, category comparisons, numeric relationships, distributions, and category counts.

## Improvements

- Suggested chart configurations load into the builder for review and are never saved automatically.
- Charts navigation stays active on both the Chart Library and Build Chart routes.

## Important behaviour notes

- Suggestions are transparent heuristics based on column types, not claims about business meaning.

## Scope relative to the previous release

- Source modules added: `components/data/DatasetIntelligencePanel.jsx`, `core/analytics/suggestions.js`, `core/data/intelligence.js`.
- Application code: 5,984 → 6,189 lines (+205).

Compared against [v0.4.72](../jsa-v0.4.72/RELEASE_NOTES.md).

## Breaking changes

None recorded. No source module present in the previous release was removed, and no route was renamed or dropped, as verified by comparing the source trees.

## Compatibility and migration

Each version directory is an independent project with its own `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. To use this release, install its dependencies inside its own folder; installing at the repository root does not apply to any version.

Datasets persisted in IndexedDB are keyed to the browser origin. Running a different version folder on a different dev-server port is a different origin, so previously saved work will not appear there. Workspace data is not migrated between versions by the repository.

## Verification status

| Check | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Test suite | **Executed and passed.** `npx vitest run` reported 17 passed and 161 passed. |
| Production build | **Not executed** in this documentation pass. |
| Browser behaviour | **Not verified** — no browser session was driven during documentation. |
| Coverage | **Not measured.** No coverage figure is claimed. |

"Executed and passed" above means the command was run against this exact folder in the documentation environment and exited successfully. It does not mean every feature was exercised, and it does not constitute a browser or security verification.
